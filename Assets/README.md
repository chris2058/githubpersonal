PROJECT NOTES:

As of 16th April 2020: The lates Bootstrap CDN link was not used, with an older version preferred, as it rendered the styling preferably. Therefore the following CDN link was chosen.

https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css">

DESIGN NOTES:

Bootstrap is the main HTML method for the site.

All pages are enclosed in an 'overall container' div, which is a 'fluid container'.

Within that, there is one main div for the content, which is either a 'jumbotron' or a 'container' div, both of which are classed as 'fluid'.

Mobile responsiveness and simplicity are points of emphasis, with minimization of text on the page without the use of popups or modals.

Base styling is done in the CSS sheet, wich simple effects also done there.

The layout of the CSS sheet is designed to reflect the order of the natural flow as one progresses through the website.

CSS ID's and class names which generally refer to only one page, start with the name of the page they focus on.


SOURCE JS FILES:

The local JS file is named 'Main.JS' and is located inside the 'Assets' folder.

CDN's are used for JQuery and bootstrap

CSS/SASS FILES:

The local CSS file is named 'Style.CSS' and is located inside the 'Assets' folder.

The Bootstrap CSS CDN link is in the header of each page.
